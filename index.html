        Evaluating real-valued expressions to high precision is a key 
        building block in computational mathematics, physics, and numerics. 
        A typical implementation uses a uniform precision for each 
        operation, and doubles that precision until the real result can be 
        bounded to some sufficiently narrow interval. However, this is
        wasteful: usually only a few operations really need to be performed
        at high precision, and the bulk of the expression could use much 
        lower precision. Uniform precision can also waste iterations 
        discovering the necessary precision and then still overestimate by 
        up to a factor of two. We propose to instead use mixed-precision 
        interval arithmetic to evaluate real-valued expressions. A key
        challenge is deriving the mixed-precision assignment both soundly 
        and quickly. To do so, we introduce a sound variation of error 
        Taylor series and condition numbers, specialized to interval 
        arithmetic, that can be evaluated with minimal overhead thanks to 
        an “exponent trick”. Our implementation, Reval, achieves an
        average speed-up of 1.47× compared to the state-of-the-art Sollya 
        tool, with the speed-up increasing to 4.92× on the most difficult 
        input points. An examination of the precisions used with and without 
        precision tuning shows that the speed-up results come from quickly 
        assigning lower precisions for the majority of operations

        Safety-critical systems with neural network components require strong 
        guarantees. While existing verification techniques have shown great 
        progress towards this goal, they mostly reason on real-valued 
        abstractions of neural networks. As soon as we consider their

        harder. In this talk, we discuss a software verification approach to

        Linear programs (LP) arise in many domains, such as robotics,
        databases, machine learning, computer graphics, etc. LP solvers are
        also widely used in the PL community for analyzing vulnerabilities in C
        source code, designing correctly rounded Math libraries, repairing deep
        neural networks, Presburger arithmetic for polyhedral compilation, etc.
        Linear programs with billions of constraints are beyond the reach of
        modern LP solvers. However, for many practical applications, the linear
        program is "low-dimensional", i.e., it has many constraints but only a
        few unknown variables. In this talk, we'll first discuss how random
        sampling can be used for provably solving (in terms of expected
        iterations) feasible low-dimensional linear programs with billions of
        constraints. Next, we'll discuss how this approach requires
        enhancements for infeasible linear programs, where a small number of
        conflicting constraints make the linear program have no solution. We'll
        show that a geometric perspective can be used for efficiently
        eliminating the conflicting constraints and computing a solution that
        satisfies the maximum number of constraints. We'll present applications
        of our LP solver for generating correctly rounded Math libraries for
        floating-point variants. Time permitting, we'll also discuss
        applications in interpretable machine learning.

          Neural networks are increasingly becoming integral to safety-critical
          applications, such as controllers in embedded systems. While formal
          safety verification focuses on idealized real-valued networks, practical
          applications require quantization to finite precision, inevitably
          introducing roundoff errors. Manually optimizing precision, especially
          for fixed-point implementation, while ensuring safety is complex and

          In this talk, I will introduce Aster, the sound, fully automated,
          mixed-precision, fixed-point quantizer for deep feed-forward neural
          networks. Aster reduces the quantization problem to a mixed-integer
          linear programming (MILP) problem, thus efficiently determining minimal
          precision to guarantee predefined error bounds. Our evaluations show
          that Aster's optimized code reduces machine cycles when compiled to an
          FPGA with a commercial HLS compiler compared to (sound)
          state-of-the-art. Furthermore, Aster handles significantly more
          benchmarks faster, especially for larger networks with thousands of
          parameters.

        A number of companies recently worked together to release the new Open
        Compute Project MX standard for low-precision computation, aimed at
        efficient neural network implementation. In our work, we describe and
        evaluate the first open-source FPGA implementation of the arithmetic
        defined in the standard. Our designs fully support all the standard's
        concrete formats for conversion into and out of MX formats and for the
        standard-defined arithmetic operations, as well as arbitrary
        fixed-point and floating-point formats. Certain elements of the
        standard are left as implementation-defined, and we present the first

        optimized hardware components is available open source, alongside our
        open-source Pytorch library for quantization into the new standard,
        integrated with the Brevitas library so that the community can develop
        novel neural network designs quantized with MX formats in mind. Our
        testing shows that MX is very effective for formats such as INT5 or FP6
        which are not natively supported on GPUs. This gives FPGAs an advantage
        as they have the flexibility to implement a custom datapath and take
        advantage of the smaller area footprints offered by these formats.

        The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE) is
        ubiquitously used for physical simulation in scientific computing and
        engineering. Ideally, a PDE solver should be opaque: the user provides
        as input the domain boundary, boundary conditions, and the governing
        equations, and the code returns an evaluator that can compute the
        value of the solution at any point of the input domain. This is
        surprisingly far from being the case for all existing open-source or
        commercial software, despite the research efforts in this direction
        and the large academic and industrial interest. To a large extent,
        this is due to lack of robustness in geometric algorithms used to
        create the discretization, detect collisions, and evaluate element
        validity.
        I will present the incremental potential contact simulation paradigm,
        which provides strong robustness guarantees in simulation codes,
        ensuring, for the first time, validity of the trajectories accounting
        for floating point rounding errors over an entire elastodynamic
        simulation with contact. A core part of this approach is the use of a
        conservative line-search to check for collisions between geometric
        primitives and for ensuring validity of the deforming elements over
        linear trajectories.
        I will discuss both problems in depth, showing that SOTA approaches
        favor numerical efficiency but are unfortunately not robust to
        floating point rounding, leading to major failures in simulation. I
        will then present an alternative approach based on judiciously using
        rational and interval types to ensure provable correctness, while
        keeping a running time comparable with non-conservative methods.
        To conclude, I will discuss a set of applications enabled by this
        approach in microscopy and biomechanics, including traction force
        estimation on a live zebrafish and efficient modeling and simulation
        of fibrous materials.

        A central challenge in scientific computing is managing the tradeoff between accuracy
        and performance. Scientific applications often require high precision to produce 
        meaningful results, but achieving this precision can reduce computational speed 
        and efficiency. For example, using higher precision arithmetic can minimize rounding 
        errors and improve the reliability of results, but it typically demands more processing 
        power and memory, which negatively affects performance. As a result, scientific software 
        developers must carefully balance the need for accuracy with the need for acceptable 
        performance.
        In recent years, programming languages like Rust have demonstrated how carefully 
        designed type systems can help developers write high-performance code while ensuring 
        critical properties, such as memory safety. In this talk, we will present our work on 
        designing type systems that provide guarantees about the accuracy of floating-point 
        computations. By introducing types that can quantitatively represent the error bounds 
        of floating-point computations, we can create statically typed programming languages 
        that alert developers to potentially significant inaccuracies early in the development 
        process.

        Since its introduction at Asiacrypt 2017, the CKKS approximate homomorphic encryption
        scheme has become one of the most widely used and implemented homomorphic encryption 
        schemes. Due to the approximate nature of the scheme, application developers using 
        CKKS must ensure that the evaluation output is within a tolerable error of the corresponding
        plaintext computation. Choosing appropriate parameters requires a good understanding of 
        how the noise will grow through the computation. A strong understanding of the noise 
        growth is also necessary to limit the performance impact of mitigations to the attacks
        on CKKS presented by Li and Micciancio (Eurocrypt 2021). In this work we present a 
        comprehensive noise analysis of CKKS, that considers noise coming both from the encoding and
        homomorphic operations. Our main contribution is the first average-case analysis for CKKS 
        noise, and we also introduce refinements to prior worst-case noise analyses. We develop 
        noise heuristics both for the original CKKS scheme and the RNS variant presented
        at SAC 2018. We then evaluate these heuristics by comparing the predicted noise growth 
        with experiments in the HEAAN and FullRNS-HEAAN libraries, and by comparing with a 
        worst-case noise analysis as done in prior work. Our findings show mixed results: while
        our new analyses lead to heuristic estimates that more closely model the observed noise
        growth than prior approaches, the new heuristics sometimes slightly underestimate the 
        observed noise growth. This evidences the need for implementation-specific noise analyses
        for CKKS, which recent work has shown to be effective for implementations of similar schemes.
        This is joint work with Anamaria Costache, Benjamin R. Curtis, Erin Hales, Sean Murphy,

        Neural networks have offered distinct advantages over traditional
        techniques. However, the opaque neural networks render their
        performance vulnerable, in the presence of adversarial samples. This
        underscores the imperative of formal verification of neural networks,
        especially in the safety-critical domain. Deep neural networks are
        composed of multiple hidden layers with neurons, where mathematical
        operations stack linear and nonlinear (activation functions)
        operations. Using linear inequalities plays a crucial role in
        constraining and deducing the ranges of results from nonlinear
        operations. Considering correlations among input variables of multiple
        neurons leads to constraints known as multi-neuron constraints, posing
        a non-trivial high-dimensional challenge in computing the convex hull
        of functions. This work is dedicated to designing methods for computing
        multi-neuron constraints for the ReLU function to serve the robustness
        verification of neural networks. We have introduced a novel approach
        WRALU (Wrapping ReLU) for computing the convex hull of a ReLU function

        This method significantly reduces computation
        time and complexity, constructing fewer constraints to achieve more
        precise approximations while handling higher dimensions.

        Logarithmic Number Systems (LNS) hold considerable promise in
        helping reduce the number of bits needed to represent a high
        dynamic range of real-numbers with finite precision, and also
        efficiently support multiplication and division. However,
        under LNS, addition and subtraction turn into non-linear
        functions that must be approximated—typically using
        precomputed table-based functions. Additionally, multiple
        layers of error correction are typically needed to improve
        result accuracy. Unfortunately, previous efforts have not
        characterized the resulting error bound. We provide the first
        rigorous analysis of LNS, covering detailed techniques such as
        co-transformation that are crucial to implementing subtraction
        with reasonable accuracy. We provide theorems capturing the
        error due to table interpolations, the finite precision of
        pre-computed values in the tables, and the error introduced by
        fix-point multiplications involved in LNS implementations. We
        empirically validate our analysis using a Python
        implementation, showing that our analytical bounds are tight,
        and that our testing campaign generates inputs diverse-enough
        to almost match (but not exceed) the analytical bounds. We
        close with discussions on how to adapt our analysis to LNS
        systems with different bases and also discuss many pragmatic
        ramifications of our work in the broader arena of scientific

        service providers. To efficiently use GPU resources and boost
        throughput, batching multiple requests has emerged as a
        popular paradigm; to further speed up batching, LLM
        quantization techniques reduce memory consumption and increase

        (e.g., 8-bit weight-activation quantization) cannot fully

        integer operators, resulting in sub-optimal performance.

        To maximize LLMs' serving throughput, we introduce Atom, a
        low-bit quantization method that achieves high throughput
        improvements with negligible accuracy loss. Atom significantly
        boosts serving throughput by using low-bit operators and
        considerably reduces memory consumption via low-bit

        up to 7.73× compared to the FP16 and by 2.53× compared to INT8

        A software designer has to carefully select the arithmetic that best
        suits each step of her application, but the choice is constrained: only
        a handful of operators are supported in hardware, in only in a handful
        of precisions.
        Conversely, when designing for hardware or FPGAs, these constraints
        become degrees of freedom. Any precision can be designed, any number
        encoding, but also any operation and function, provided you are clever
        enough to implement it efficiently as a circuit.
        <br>
        This talk will expose some of the opportunities offered by this freedom,
        and some of the methodologies and tools that allow a designer to build
        and compose application-specific operators.
        It may include some inadvertent advertising for our upcoming 800-page
        book dedicated to these topics.

        Due to the limits of finite precision arithmetic, as one works
        with floating-point representations of real numbers in
        computer programs, round-off errors tend to accumulate under
        mathematical operations and may become unacceptably large.
        Symbolic Taylor Error Expressions is a technique used in the
        tool FPTaylor to bound the round-off errors accumulated under
        differentiable mathematical operations which provides a good
        trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. In this
        presentation, I will present a formally verified
        implementation of Symbolic Taylor Error Expressions in a
        specification language, automated theorem prover, and
        typechecker called Prototype Verification System (PVS). I will
        also go over how this formal specification in PVS will enable
        the integration of Symbolic Taylor Expressions in PRECiSA, a

        automated reasoning techniques in these domains, it is
        necessary to develop a tool that can handle logical encodings

        In this talk, I will present the design and implementation of
        a delta-decision procedure, dReal. First, we will discuss the

        high-consequence programs in C. Two methods we use at Sandia
        to accomplish this verification are: fully constructive proofs

        verification (using Frama-C). In both cases, the addition of
        numerical computations adds complexity to the programs, via
        numerical error (e.g., discretization or roundoff error), or
        run-time errors (such as floating-point exceptions). We

One downside to this (perhaps excessive) flexibility is that numerical instability and the occasional typo can easily turn a solution into a pile of NaNs.

        We present a novel computer-aided design (CAD) modeling system designed
        to support a modeling range that matches the fabrication range of
        modern additive manufacturing (AM) systems that are capable of
        producing large-scale, high-resolution parts. To be useful to designers
        and fabricators, a modeling system must perform essential functions
        (such as execution of modeling operations, visualization, and slicing)
        at interactive rates, and achieving the necessary performance depends
        on efficient use of both memory and computing capacity. Our approach to
        achieving necessary performance levels is to implement an implicit
        function-based representation (f-rep) modeling system, not using a
        computer algebra system, but instead using just-in-time (JIT)
        compilation of user-defined functions. Efficient memory usage is
        achieved via a sparse volume data structure that builds on previous
        work by Hoetzlein [Hoetzlein 2016]. Computational efficiency is
        achieved through a combination of interval arithmetic (IA) and
        massively parallel evaluation on the GPU. We follow [Keeter 2020] and
        employ IA as the basis for local pruning of the function evaluation
        tree to minimize the required number of function evaluations, and we
        take advantage of GPU-parallelism to significantly enhance
        computational throughput.

        Testing code for floating-point exceptions is crucial as exceptions can
        quickly propagate and produce unreliable numerical answers. The
        state-of-the-art to test for floating-point exceptions in GPUs is quite
        limited and solutions require the application's source code, which
        precludes their use in accelerated libraries where the source is not
        publicly available. We present an approach to find inputs that trigger
        floating-point exceptions in black-box GPU functions, i.e., functions
        where the source code and information about input bounds are
        unavailable. Our approach is the first to use Bayesian optimization
        (BO) to identify such inputs and uses novel strategies to overcome the
        challenges that arise in applying BO to this problem. We implement our
        approach in the Xscope framework and demonstrate it on 58 functions
        from the CUDA Math Library and functions from ten HPC programs. Xscope
        is able to identify inputs that trigger exceptions in about 72% of the
        tested functions.

        Standard implementations of functions like sin and exp optimize for
        accuracy, not speed, because they are intended for general-purpose use.
        But just like many applications tolerate inaccuracy from cancellation,
        rounding error, and singularities, many applications could also
        tolerate less-accurate function implementations. This raises an
        intriguing possibility: speeding up numerical code by using different
        function implementations.

        Enter OpTuner, an automated tool for selecting the best implementation
        for each mathematical function call site. OpTuner uses error Taylor
        series and integer linear programming to compute optimal assignments of
        297 function implementations to call sites and presents the user with a
        speed-accuracy Pareto curve. In a case study on the POV-Ray ray tracer,
        OpTuner speeds up a critical computation by 2.48×, leading to a whole
        program speedup of 1.09× with no change in the program output; human
        efforts result in slower code and lower-quality output. On a broader
        study of 36 standard benchmarks, OpTuner demonstrates speedups of 2.05×
        for negligible decreases in accuracy and up to 5.37× for error-tolerant
        applications.

        Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers have gained widespread
        popularity as reasoning engines in numerous formal methods
        applications, including in syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS)
        applications. In this talk, we focus on an emerging class of
        applications for syntax-guided synthesis, namely, the use of a SyGuS
        solver to (partially) automate further development and improvements to
        the SMT solver itself. We describe several recent features in the SMT
        solver cvc5 that follow this paradigm. These include syntax-guided
        enumeration of rewrite rules, selection of test inputs, and discovery
        of solved forms for quantified constraints. For the latter, we describe
        how syntax-guided synthesis recently played a pivotal role in the
        development of a new algorithm for quantified bit-vector constraints
        based on invertibility conditions, and how this technique can be
        extended for similar algorithms that target quantified constraints in
        other theories, including the theory of floating points.

        Exact real arithmetic systems can specify any amount of precision on
        the output of the computations. They are used in a wide variety of
        applications when a high degree of precision is necessary. Some of
        these applications include: differential equation solvers, linear
        equation solvers, large scale mathematical models, and SMT solvers.
        This talk describes a new exact real arithmetic system which uses lazy
        list of floating point numbers to represent the real numbers.  It
        details algorithms for basic arithmetic computations on these
        structures and proves their correctness.  This proposed system has the
        advantage of algorithms which can be supported by modern floating point
        hardware, while still being a lazy exact real arithmetic system

        RLIBM-32 provides a set of techniques to develop correctly rounded math
        libraries for 32-bit float and posit types. It enhances our RLibm
        approach that frames the problem of generating correctly rounded
        libraries as a linear programming problem in the context of 16-bit
        types to scale to 32-bit types. Specifically, this talk with detail new
        algorithms to (1) generate polynomials that produce correctly rounded
        outputs for all inputs using counterexample guided polynomial
        generation, (2) generate efficient piecewise polynomials with
        bit-pattern based domain splitting, and (3) deduce the amount of
        freedom available to produce correct results when range reduction
        involves multiple elementary functions. The resultant math library for
        the 32-bit float type is faster than state-of-the-art math libraries
        while producing the correct output for all inputs. We have also
        developed a set of correctly rounded elementary functions for 32-bit
        posits.

        POP: fast and efficient bit-level precision tuning

        Dorra gave a great demo of <a href="">POP</a>, a tool from her thesis
        work on precision tuning. Summarizing from her abstract: POP
        establishes novel techniques for precision tuning. The main idea of our
        approach is based on semantic modeling of the propagation of the
        numerical errors throughout the program source. This yields a system of
        constraints whose minimal solution gives the best tuning of the
        program. Based on a static analysis approach, we formulate the problem
        of precision tuning with two different methods. The first method
        combines a forward and a backward error analysis which are two popular
        paradigms of error analysis. Next, our analysis is expressed as a set
        of linear constraints, made of propositional logic formulas and
        relations between integer elements only, checked by a SMT solver. The
        second method consists of generating an Integer Linear Problem (ILP)
        from the program. This is done by reasoning on the most significant bit
        and the number of significant bits of the values which are integer
        quantities. The integer solution to this problem, computed in
        polynomial time by a classical linear programming solver, gives the
        optimal data types at bit-level. A finer set of semantic equations is
        also proposed which does not reduce directly to an ILP problem. We use
        the policy iteration technique to find a solution.  The POP tool
        implements both methods, and in this session Dorra demonstrateed it
        across several benchmarks coming from various application domains such
        as embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT), physics, etc.

        High performance computing (HPC) is central to solving large problems
        in science and engineering through the deployment of massive amounts of
        computational power. The development of important pieces of HPC
        software spans years or even decades, involving dozens of computer and
        domain scientists. During this period, the core functionality of the
        software is made more efficient, new features are added, and the
        software is ported across multiple platforms. Porting of software in
        general involves the change of compilers, optimization levels,
        arithmetic libraries, and many other aspects that determine the machine
        instructions that actually get executed. Unfortunately, such changes do
        affect the computed results to a significant (and often worrisome)
        extent. In a majority of cases, there are not easily definable a priori
        answers one can check against. A programmer ends up comparing the new
        answer against a trusted baseline previously established or checks for
        indirect confirmations such as whether physical properties such as
        energy are conserved. However, such non-systematic efforts might miss
        underlying issues, and the code may keep misbehaving until these are
        fixed.

        </p><p>

        In this session, Allison presented real-world evidence to show that
        ignoring numerical result changes can lead to misleading scientific
        conclusions.  She presented techniques and tools that can help
        computational scientists understand and analyze compiler effects on
        their scientific code. These techniques are applicable across a wide
        range of examples to narrow down the root-causes to single files,
        functions within files, and even computational expressions that affect
        specific variables. The developer may then rewrite the code selectively
        and/or suppress the application of certain optimizations to regain more
        predictable behavior.

        Rival: an interval arithmetic for robust error estimation
      </div>
      <div class="speaker">

        <p>

        Interval arithmetic is a simple way to compute a mathematical
        expression to an arbitrary accuracy, widely used for verifying
        floating-point computations. Yet this simplicity belies challenges.
        Some inputs violate preconditions or cause domain errors. Others cause
        the algorithm to enter an infinite loop and fail to compute a ground
        truth. Plus, finding valid inputs is itself a challenge when invalid
        and unsamplable points make up the vast majority of the input space.
        These issues can make interval arithmetic brittle and temperamental.

        </p><p>

        Rival introduces three extensions to interval arithmetic to
        address these challenges. Error intervals express rich notions of input
        validity and indicate whether all or some points in an interval violate
        implicit or explicit preconditions. Movability flags detect futile
        recomputations and prevent timeouts by indicating whether a
        higher-precision recomputation will yield a more accurate result. And
        input search restricts sampling to valid, samplable points, so they are
        easier to find. We compare these extensions to the state-of-the-art
        technical computing software Mathematica, and demonstrate that our
        extensions are able to resolve 60.3% more challenging inputs, return
        10.2× fewer completely indeterminate results, and avoid 64 cases of
        fatal error.
