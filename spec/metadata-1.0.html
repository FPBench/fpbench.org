  <h1>FPBench 1.0 standards</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="../../">FPBench</a> is a standard benchmark suite for the
    floating point community to organize its efforts around. The
    benchmark suite is organized around a common format and a common set
    of measures of accuracy. FPBench 1.0 is the first version of this
    common format and set of measures.
  </p>

  <p>
    FPBench 1.0 standardizes:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="fpcore-1.0.html">The FPCore input format</a></li>
    <li><a href="metadata-1.0.html">Metadata for FPCore benchmarks</a></li>
    <li><a href="measures-1.0.html">Standard measures of error</a></li>

  <h2>FPCore metadata properties</h2>

  <p>
    The metadata properties allow describing additional information
    about each benchmark, such as their name, description,
    precision, citations, or preconditions.
  </p>
</header>


<p>
  FPBench 1.0 defines the meaning of the following properties:
</p>

<dl class="code-terms">
  <dt>:name</dt>
  <dd>
    A string name for the benchmark. If a name is needed and not
    provided, we recommend using the body expression.
  </dd>

  <dt>:description</dt>
  <dd>
    A string description for the benchmark and its inputs. We
    recommend describing the physical meaning and units of inputs
    when applicable.
  </dd>

  <dt>:cite</dt>
  <dd>
    A list of symbols that describe the sources of the benchmark.
    We recommend making available a BibTeX file which uses the
    same symbols as keys.
  </dd>

  <dt>:precision</dt>
  <dd>
    Describes the floating point precision used for floating point
    values in the expression. It is expected to be a symbol for one of
    the IEEE-754 names (such as <code>binary32</code>
    and <code>binary64</code>). If no <code>:precision</code> property is
    specified, implementations should assume <code>binary64</code>
    floating-point values.
  </dd>

  <dt>:pre</dt>
  <dd>
    A precondition on inputs to the benchmark. Tools should not use
    points that fail the precondition to determine the accuracy of the
    benchmark. It is expected to be
    an <a href="fpcore-1.0.html#g:expression">expression</a> that
    returns a boolean value.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>:math-library</dt>
  <dd>
    The library used in the source to implement floating-point
    operations. It is expected to be a symbol identifying a library
    implementation and version, such as <code>gnu-libm-2.34</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Additionally, properties prefixed by the name of a tool (such
  as <code>:xxx-foobar</code>) are reserved for definition by that
  tool. Only that tool may define the meaning of those properties;
  other tools should not depend on the meaning of those
  properties, nor must the defining tool keep the meaning constant.
