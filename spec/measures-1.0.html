  <h1>FPBench 1.0 standards</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="../">FPBench</a> is a standard benchmark suite for the
    floating point community. The benchmark suite contains a common format
    for floating-point computation and metadata and a common set
    of accuracy measures:

  <h2>FPBench Standard Measures</h2>
  
  <p>
    FPBench standardizes several measures of accuracy; tools that measure
    accuracy should state which of the FPBench accuracy measures they use, so
    that the community can more easily compare tools.
  </p>
</header>

<p>
  FPBench analyses floating-point accuracy along several axes:
  scaling vs non-scaling error, forward vs. backward error, and maximum vs.
  average error. Tools that measure error may use sound vs. statistical
  techniques, and tools that transform programs have several options for how to
  measure accuracy improvement.
</p>

<h3>Scaling vs. non-scaling error (\(\varepsilon\))</h3>

<p>
  There are several ways to measure the error of producing the inaccurate value
  \(\hat x\) instead of the true value \(x\). Two common mathematical notions are
  the absolute and relative error:
</p>
<figure>
\[
\varepsilon_{\text{abs}}(x, x') = \left|x - \hat x\right|
\quad \text{and} \quad
\varepsilon_{\text{rel}}(x, x') = \left|\frac{x - \hat x}{x}\right|
\]
</figure>

<p>
  Relative error scales with the quantity being measured, and thus makes sense
  for measuring both large and small numbers, much like the floating-point
  format itself. A notion of error more closely tied to the floating-point
  format is the Units in the Last Place (ULPs) difference.
</p>
<aside>
  Unfortunately, the term Units in the Last Place, or ULPs, means different
  things in the mathematical and programming communities. We use the definition
  common for programming tools, such as
  <a href="https://github.com/StanfordPL/stoke">STOKE-FP</a>.
</aside>
<p>
  Some tools instead use the logarithm of the ULPs, which approximately
  describes the number of incorrect low-order bits in \(\hat x\). These two
  measures are defined as:
</p>
<figure>
\[
\varepsilon_{\text{ulps}}(x, x') = |\mathbb{F} \cap [\min(x, \hat x), \max(x, \hat x)]|
\quad \text{and} \quad
\varepsilon_{\text{bits}}(x, x') = \log_2 \varepsilon_{\text{ulps}}(x, x')
\]
</figure>

<p>
  The floating-point numbers are distributed roughly exponentially, so this
  measure of error scales in a similar manner to relative error; however, it
  is better-behaved in the presence of denormal numbers and infinities.
</p>

<h3>Forward vs. backward error (\(\epsilon\))</h3>

<p>
  Forward error and backward error are two common measures for the error of a
  mathematical <i>computation</i>. For a true function \(f\) and its
  approximation \(\hat f\), forward error measures the difference between
  outputs for a fixed input, while backward error measures the difference
  between inputs for a fixed output. Formally:
</p>
<aside> Where \(n\) is the number of arguments. </aside>
<figure>
\[
  \epsilon_{fwd}(f, \hat{f}, x) = \varepsilon(f(x), \hat{f}(x))
\]
\[
  \epsilon_{bwd}(f, \hat{f}, x) =
    \min \left\{ \varepsilon(x, x') : x' \in \mathbb{F}^n \land {\hat f}(x') = f(x) \right\}
\]
</figure>

<p>
  Backward error is important for evaluating the stability of an algorithm, and
  in scientific applications where multiple sources of error (algorithmic error
      vs. sensor error) must be compared. Existing tools typically measure
  forward error because backward error can be tricky to compute for
  floating-point computations, where there may not be an input that produces
  the true output.

<h3>Average vs. maximum error (\(E\))</h3>

<p>
  Describing the error of a floating-point computation means summarizing its
  behaviour across multiple inputs. Existing tools use either maximum or
  average error for this task. Formally:
</p>
<aside>
  Where \(N\) is the number of valid inputs, and \(n\) is the number of arguments.
</aside>
<figure>
\[
  E_{\text{max}}(f, \hat{f}) = \max \left\{\epsilon(f, \hat{f}, x) : x \in \mathbb{F}^n\right\}
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  E_{\text{avg}}(f, \hat{f}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x\in \mathbb{F}^n} \epsilon(f, \hat{f}, x)
\]
</figure>

<p>
  Worst-case error tends to be easier to measure soundly, while average error
  tends to be easier to measure statistically.
</p>

<h3>Sound vs. statistical techniques</h3>

<p>
  Running a floating-point program on all valid inputs is intractable. Existing
  tools either soundly overapproximate the error using static analysis, or
  approximate the error using statistical sampling.
</p>

<p>
  Most static techniques are based on interval or affine arithmetic to
  over-approximate floating-point arithmetic, often using abstract
  interpretation. Abstract interpretation may use either non-relational or
  relational abstract domains, and may use acceleration techniques (widenings)
  to over-approximate loops without unrolling them. While such techniques tend
  to provide loose over-approximations of the floating-point error of programs,
  they are fast and provide sound error bounds. In some embedded applications,
  correctness is critical and unsound techniques will not do.
</p>

<p>
  In domains where correctness is not absolutely critical, sampling can provide
  tight approximations of error. Many sampling techniques are used, including
  naive random samples and Markov-chain Monte Carlo. These techniques involve
  running a program multiple times, so they tend to be slower than static
  analysis.
</p>

<h3>Measuring improvement (\(\iota\))</h3>

<p>
  Tools that <i>transform</i> floating-point programs need to compare the
  accuracy of two floating-point implementations of a function, the original
  and the transformed. Several comparison measures are possible. Comparisons
  can use the improvement in worst-case or average error between the original
  \(\hat f\) and improved \(\hat f'\) implementation of the same mathematical
  function \(f\):
</p>

\[
  \iota_{\text{imp}} = E(f, \hat{f}) - E(f, \hat{f}')
\]

<p>
  However, one cannot usually improve the accuracy of a computation
  simultaneously on all inputs. It is thus often necessary to make a
  computation less accurate on some points to make it more accurate overall. In
  this case, it may be useful to report the largest unimprovement, which
  measures the cost of improving accuracy:
</p>

<figure>
\[
  \iota_{\text{wrs}}(\hat{f},\hat{f}') = \max \left\{ \epsilon(f, \hat{f}', x) - \epsilon(f, \hat{f}', x)
\ :\ x\in \mathbb{F}^n\right\}
\]
