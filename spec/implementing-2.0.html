  <aside>
    These notes are a guide for implementors of FPBench. If they seem
    to conflict with the standard, the standards text takes priority.

  <p>
    As the FPBench feature set grows, implementing FPBench can look
    more and more intimidating. But it shouldn't. These notes are our
    collective advice on implementing the FPBench standards, and
    should clarify the standards.
  </p>

  <h2>What you can skip</h2>

  <p>
    Not every feature of the standard needs to be implemented. For example,
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Metadata properties, such as <code>:math-library</code>, are optional.</li>
    <li>Operations and constants, such as <code>log2</code> or <code>PI</code>, are optional</li>
    <li>Syntactic constructs, such as the different number formats, are optional</li>
    <li>Semantic constructs, such as conditionals and loops, are optional</li>
    <li>Rounding modes and precisions, such as <code>binary32</code>, are optional</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Focus on correctness for features you <em>do</em> implement,
    rather than the breadth of features you support. Plus, correctly
    implementing a feature usually only requires care, while
    implementing new features can require fundamental research.
  </p>

  <p>
    Different interpretations are more harmful to interoperability
    than missing features. <em>Tools should, however, publish which
    features they support.</em> Users can then use tools like the
    FPBench <code>filter</code> script to select the subsets of their
    benchmarks supported by a tool.
  </p>

  <p>Note that some syntactic constructs, like the multiple numeric
  formats and the sequential <code>let*</code> and <code>while*</code>
  constructs, can be desugared into their non-sequential counterparts.
  Users can use the FPBench <a href="../tools.html">tools</a> to
  automate this desugaring.</p>

  <h2>What you can reject</h2>

  <p>
    Tools are free to reject any FPCore as unsupported. The FPCore
    standard is quite flexible, but this flexibility means that it is
    difficult for a tool to behave equally well on all inputs. For
    example, mixed-precision operations can be tedious to implement,
    while loops may be outside the purview of many techniques.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Tools should, however, make sure to raise an error when an FPCore
    is unsupported</em>, instead of simply returning invalid results. For
    example, a tool that does not support mixed precision operations
    should raise an error instead of ignoring the precision
    annotations and producing incorrect results.
  </p>

  <h2>What you can add</h2>

  <p>
    Tools are free to add features to the standard, as long as they
    namespace them to avoid conflicts. For example, tools can add:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Custom metadata properties, such as <code>:herbie-status</code>.</li>
    <li>Custom operations or constants, such as <code>median</code> or <code>PHI</code></li>
    <li>Custom syntactic constructs, such as new number formats or strings</li>
    <li>Custom semantic constructs, such as nondeterminism or fixpoints</li>
    <li>Custom rounding modes and precisions, such as <code>posit16</code> or <code>(fixed 12 4)</code></li>
    <li>Custom types, such as complex numbers or matrices</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Namespaced names, like <code>rosa-accuracy</code> are
    future-proof, while it is possible that future standards might
    define standard functions like <code>median</code>. Where multiple
    plausible interpretations exist, namedspaced names are better.
